//! Composer's vendored runtime files: copied verbatim from the
//! pinned upstream release into the crate, written into the user's
//! `vendor/composer/` at dump time.
//!
//! The bytes are baked into the binary via `include_bytes!`. Bump
//! [`crate::REFERENCE_COMPOSER_VERSION`] in lockstep with replacing
//! the source files under `vendored/composer-<version>/` and
//! regenerating the byte-equivalence fixtures.
//!
//! `platform_check.php` is *not* a vendored file — Composer generates
//! it per-project from the resolved platform requirements rather than
//! shipping a fixed copy (as Composer-consuming tools do) in
//! [`crate::emit::platform_check`]; it's emitted (conditionally, when
//! `config.platform-check` is on and there's something to check) by
//! [`crate::Autoloader::emit`], not from this module.
