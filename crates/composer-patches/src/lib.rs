//! Native reimplementation of the `cweagans/composer-patches` plugin.
//!
//! this crate never runs the PHP plugin (per the no-plugins invariant); this crate
//! reproduces its effect: resolve the set of `(target package → [patches])`
//! from the **root** project, materialize each patch, and apply it to the
//! freshly-extracted package tree during install. Patches are applied
//! in-process with the [`flickzeug`] fuzzy-matching diff library — never by
//! shelling out to `git apply` / `patch` — so behavior is identical across
//! Linux, macOS, and Windows.
//!
//! The crate is intentionally FS/PHP-agnostic, like `composer-installers` and
//! the sibling installer crates: it parses, plans, and applies; the host
//! (`this crate-composer-resolver`'s install orchestrator) decides *when* to call
//! it and wires it into the install lifecycle.
//!
//! # Module map
//!
//! - [`model`] — the internal [`Patch`] model + v1/v2 dialect normalization.
//! - [`diff`] — multi-file diff splitting + `-p` path stripping (over flickzeug).
//! - [`apply`] — apply a patch to a tree with the `-p` fallback loop.
//! - [`make`] — author a patch from an edited tree (the inverse of `apply`).
//! - [`resolve`] — build the root patch set from `composer.json` + patches-file.
//! - [`plan`] — the materialized [`PatchPlan`] + re-application fingerprints.
//! - [`pass`] — the per-package apply pass (+ `PATCHES.txt`).
//! - [`lock`] — the `patches.lock.json` applied-state store.
//! - [`target`] — the `patches/` dir header-inference router.
//! - [`report`] — per-application outcome ([`ApplyReport`]).
